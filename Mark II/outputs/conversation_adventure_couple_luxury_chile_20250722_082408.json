      "body": "Hey Carlos,\n\nJake and Emma Wilson here! Thanks so much for reaching out and offering to plan our Chilean adventure \u2013 sounds amazing! Chile has been on our bucket list forever.\n\nSo, to give you a better idea of what we're thinking: We're looking at traveling sometime next month, and it'll just be the two of us. As for budget, we're hoping to stay somewhere in the $6000-$10000 range, give or take a little depending on the experiences, of course!\n\nWe're pretty active and love a good adrenaline rush! Think extreme sports, hiking \u2013 anything that gets us outdoors and moving. Photography is a huge passion for both of us, so stunning landscapes are a must! Oh, and we definitely can't forget the wine tasting. We're big fans of a good Malbec or Cabernet Sauvignon (or anything else you recommend!).\n\nBasically, we're looking for a mix of adventure, natural beauty, and, of course, a little bit of luxury thrown in there. We're open to your suggestions and excited to see what you come up with!\n\nCheers,\n\nJake & Emma Wilson",

      "body": "Wow! Emma and I are practically buzzing with excitement! That proposal looks absolutely incredible. The pictures are stunning, and the itinerary sounds like a dream. We're already picturing ourselves there!\n\nJust one thing popped into our heads as we were reading through it. We're really keen on experiencing the *real* [Destination Name] \u2013 getting a feel for the local culture, stumbling upon hidden gems, and maybe even getting a little off the beaten path. Does the itinerary allow for that kind of spontaneity, or is it geared more towards the well-trodden tourist spots? We're just a little worried about missing out on the authentic side of things.\n\nAlso, while we're absolutely drooling over the luxury aspects, we're also trying to keep the whole trip within a reasonable budget. Just roughly, what would you say the total cost comes to? We're aiming to stay under $10,000 if possible, so knowing a ballpark figure would be super helpful.\n\nThanks again for putting this together! We're really looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest,\n\nJake and Emma Wilson",
