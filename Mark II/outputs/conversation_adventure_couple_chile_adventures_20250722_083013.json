      "body": "Hey!\n\nWow, this proposal looks absolutely incredible! Emma and I are practically drooling over the itinerary. The pictures alone have us itching to pack our bags. The [mention a specific activity you liked] sounds like something we'd absolutely love, and the [mention another specific activity] is just... *chef's kiss*.\n\nWe're particularly keen on making sure we don't end up in super touristy spots. We're really looking for authentic experiences and a chance to connect with the local culture, so we were wondering how the proposed itinerary balances the luxury aspects with opportunities to explore more off-the-beaten-path.\n\nAlso, just to be upfront, we're working with a budget of around $10,000 max for this trip. So, just wanted to be sure we're on the same page regarding pricing as we start discussing details.\n\nThanks again for putting this together! We're super excited to hear more!\n\nBest,\n\nJake & Emma Wilson",
